# pandoc-abstract-book

The point of this repository is to provide a pandoc workflow for generating conference abstract books using Markdown and YAML. The idea is to use the same content to generate both HTML (styled with CSS) and PDF (typeset with XeLaTeX) for web and print without doing any extra work.
